# eval-speech-to-text

fast.py originally from https://www.alexkras.com/transcribing-audio-file-to-text-with-google-cloud-speech-api-and-python/ with some edits in my version

parts: Contains samples of Mozilla's Common Voice data converted to .wav files.

requirements.txt : required to run the fast.py code

accent_key.txt : a key for all of the accents in the output files since they are stripped of that data for processing
